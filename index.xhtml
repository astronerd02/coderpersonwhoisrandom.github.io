		<br/>
		<p id="p-1">So you want to simplify radicals? If not, go somewhere else, this is not for you. But for everybody else, we will start with explaining what a radical is.</p>
		<p id="p-2">So this is a radical: <math><msqrt><mi>4</mi></msqrt></math>, which is just equal to 2 since 4 is a square number. It is just a number under the square root sign. Most radicals are like this, <math><msqrt><mi>8</mi></msqrt></math>, which is a nasty irrational number. Instead of trying to find the nasty decimal, you can simplify the radical. The content below is a step by step guide on how to simplify a radical, in this case, <math><msqrt><mi>8</mi></msqrt></math></p>
		<center><h3>Simplifying <math><msqrt><mi>8</mi></msqrt></math></h3></center>
		<ol id="no-variable-list">
			<li class="list-1"> Find the factors of 8, (2, 4) and (1, 8)</li>
			<li class="list-1"> Look for a factor pair with a square number, in this case (2, 4) because 4 is a square number</li>
			<li class="list-1"> Don't forget that you are working with radicals</li>
			<li class="list-1"> Multiply <math><msqrt><mi>4</mi></msqrt></math> and <math><msqrt><mi>2</mi></msqrt></math></li>
			<li class="list-1"> Reduce <math><msqrt><mi>4</mi></msqrt></math> to 2 </li>
			<li class="list-1"> You are multiplying 2 and <math><msqrt><mi>2</mi></msqrt></math>, and the product is this: 2<math><msqrt><mi>2</mi></msqrt></math></li>
			<li class="list-1"> Double check your math</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Now for the breakdown of what happened. So first off, you CAN multiply 2 radicals, such as <math><msqrt><mi>2</mi></msqrt></math> &middot; <math><msqrt><mi>4</mi></msqrt></math> = <i><math><msqrt><mi>8</mi></msqrt></math></i>. So the first step is self-explanitory, you are just finding the factors of the number under the square root sign. The next step exists because you can only simplify radicals with a square number in their factors, and if there is none, it is already simplified. If you were doing it correctly and used a square number in your factors, reduce the square number by finding the square root either by memory or calculator. In the example above it was <span class="italics" id="bad-number"><math><msqrt><mi>4</mi></msqrt></math></span> &middot; <math><msqrt><mi>2</mi></msqrt></math>, you would reduce <span class="italics"><math><msqrt><mi>4</mi></msqrt></math></span> to 2, multiply 2 &middot; <math><msqrt><mi>2</mi></msqrt></math> to get 2<math><msqrt><mi>2</mi></msqrt></math>. And that is how you simplify square roots!</p> 
		<center><h3>Simplifying Radicals with variables</h3></center>
		<p>So now you know (hopefully) how to simplify radicals with only whole numbers (negative numbers have no square roots), but you may see a variable
		from time to time. So to start with the basics, lets view <math><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></math>. So you see it has the exponent 2, which means it is x squared. So here is some knowledge, squaring and square rooting are inverse opperations, meaning if you do both to a number or variable, you would end up where you started. You are doing that to x, so the answer is x. But what about <math><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></math>? The first step to solving this is to break down <math><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow></math>. So the exponent 3 means you are multiplying 3 x's together, so the broken down verison is <math><msqrt><mi>x &middot; x &middot; x</mi></msqrt></math>. We already established that <math><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></math> = x, so for every two x's under the radical sign, we can bring one x in front of it. Because there are 3 x's under the radical sign, we can replace two of the x's under the sign for 1 x outside of the sign, and leave the leftover x under there to get us our final answer of x<math><msqrt><mi>x</mi></msqrt></math>. Now that you know what is going on, now for a shortcut. divide the exponent by 2, if it is an even number, there will be nothing left beneath the radical sign, but id it is odd, there will always be one x under the radical sign.</p>
